How to Use Base64 to Audio Online Tool
======================================

Base64 is a popular encoding scheme used to convert binary data into a textual format. It is commonly used in various applications, including audio encoding and decoding. If you ever come across a Base64-encoded audio file and want to convert it back to its original format, the Base64 to Audio online tool is your go-to solution.

This article will guide you through the basics of Base64 encoding and decoding, and show you how to use the Base64 to Audio online tool effectively.

### Understanding Base64 Encoding

Before we dive into the tool itself, let's briefly cover the concept of Base64 encoding. In simple terms, Base64 encoding converts binary data into a string of ASCII characters. It is widely used for transmitting data over systems that only support text-based formats.

The Base64 encoding scheme uses a set of 64 different characters, consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and two additional characters. These characters ensure that the encoded data remains compatible with different computer systems.
