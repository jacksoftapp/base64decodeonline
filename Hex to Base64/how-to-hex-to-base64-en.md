How to Use Hex to Base64 Online Tool
====================================

Hexadecimal and Base64 are two commonly used encoding systems in computer science. Hexadecimal, or simply hex, is a base-16 numeral system, while Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes. Converting data between these two formats is a common task in programming and data processing. In this article, we will introduce an online tool that simplifies the process of converting hex to Base64 and explain how to use it effectively.

**Understanding Hexadecimal and Base64 Encoding**

Before we delve into the practical application of the online tool, it's essential to understand the basics of hexadecimal and Base64 encoding.

Hexadecimal is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses 16 distinct symbols, comprising the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F (or a-f) to represent values from 0 to 15. For example, the decimal value of 10 is represented as 'A' in hexadecimal, 15 as 'F', and 16 as '10'. Hexadecimal is commonly used in computing to represent byte values, memory addresses, and color codes.

Base64, on the other hand, is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It is often used to encode binary data, such as images, audio files, and cryptographic keys, into a text-based format that can be safely transmitted over text-based protocols, such as email or HTML forms. Base64 encoding uses a set of 64 printable characters to represent binary data, making it suitable for transferring binary data through text-based mediums.
