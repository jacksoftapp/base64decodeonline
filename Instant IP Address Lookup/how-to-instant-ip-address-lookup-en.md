IP addresses come in two versions: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses consist of four sets of numbers separated by periods, while IPv6 addresses contain eight sets of alphanumeric characters separated by colons. The IP address lookup tool we will discuss primarily focuses on IPv4 addresses.
