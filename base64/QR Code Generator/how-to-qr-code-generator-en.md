### Understanding QR Codes

QR codes, short for Quick Response codes, are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data. They were first developed in Japan in 1994 by Denso Wave, a subsidiary of Toyota, and have since gained widespread popularity worldwide. QR codes can be scanned using a smartphone or a QR code scanner, allowing users to access digital content such as websites, videos, contact information, and more.

QR codes consist of black squares arranged on a white background, typically in a square shape. These codes can store a large amount of information compared to traditional barcodes. The information stored within a QR code can include alphanumeric text, URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, and even multimedia files.
