How to Use Base64 to Text Online Tool
=====================================

Base64 is a widely used encoding scheme that allows binary data to be transmitted over text-based protocols such as email or HTTP. It converts binary data into a set of ASCII characters, making it easier to transport and store. However, encoded data cannot be easily understood by humans. This is where the Base64 to Text online tool comes in handy. In this article, we will explore the basic knowledge of Base64 and guide you on how to use this tool effectively.

### Understanding Base64 Encoding

Base64 encoding is a way of representing binary data in an ASCII string format. It uses a set of 64 characters (hence the name Base64) that consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and two additional characters, usually "+" and "/". The encoding process takes each set of three bytes from the input data and converts them into four ASCII characters.

This encoding scheme is commonly used in scenarios where binary data needs to be transmitted or stored in a text-based format. For example, it is often used in email attachments, image or file uploads on websites, or when encoding sensitive data for transmission over HTTP.

### Introducing the Base64 to Text Online Tool

The Base64 to Text online tool is a convenient and user-friendly solution that allows you to quickly decode Base64-encoded data and convert it back to its original form. By using this online tool, you can easily extract the content of Base64 strings without having to deal with complex encoding algorithms.
